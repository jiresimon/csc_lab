# Program to Calculate the Geometric and Arithmetic Mean

Here's a program to calculate the geometric and arithmetic mean of positive values.

## _How the program works_

The program allows input of positive values through the while loop and terminates the loop if you input a negative value.

The program uses some math functions like "prod", "sum", "pow" by importing the math module.

Program also uses the try and except error handling of a zero division error.
