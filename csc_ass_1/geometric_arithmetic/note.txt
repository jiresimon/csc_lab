Geometric mean and arithmetic mean

While running the codes, I can see that the code runs without an error when calculating the geometric and arithmetic mean of positive values of x.

Anytime there's an input of a negative number, the loop gets terminated and there's an answer based on the inital positive values of x entered before the negative number.

There's an except block that handles anyother error from the input.


==================================================================
Natural logarithm

While running the program, the program returns the answer of negative values of x which are the legal values.

The code keeps running because the user-defined function is called each time there's a valid value of x.

When I input a positive value of x which is an illegal input, the loop gets terminated or there's a break out from the loop and the program ends.

All other errors I encountered where handles by the except and else blocks.

================================================================
Conclusion

Both programs where able to calculate the geometric mean, arithmetic mean and the natural logarithm of valid entries of x.
