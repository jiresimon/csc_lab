# PROGRAM TO CALCULATE NATURAL LOGARITHM OF VALUES OF X

This program calculates the natural logarithm of values of x through the math module using "log".

## _How the program works_

The program also uses a while loop to check for valid values of x. 

The program or loop terminates if the value of x is invalid through the use of a break statement.

...Using the user-defined function(natural_logarithm) allows the code to recall itself after calculating the logarithm of a valid value of x.

There's also the use of exception handling through the "try/except" statement.
