# PROGRAM TO CALCULATE NATURAL LOGARITHM OF VALUES OF X

This program calculates the natural logarithm of values of x through the math module using "log"

## _How the program works_

The program also uses a while loop to check for valid values of x. 

The program or loop terminates if the value of x is invalid through teh use of a break statement.

Using the user-defined function(natural_logarithm) allows the code to recall itself after calculating the logarithm of a valid value of x.
