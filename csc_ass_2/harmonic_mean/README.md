# **HARMONIC MEAN CODE**

The program uses the user defined function to calculate the harmonic mean of positive values of x given.

## _While loop_

The while loop is used to read in input values of x and a for loop. 

This contains some conditions which the conditional statements take care of.

The try and except statement is also used to handle "value error" from the input of the user.

**Note:** The loop breaks if there's an input of negative a value of x

## _For loop_

Plays an integral part in the calculation of the harmonic mean. It iterates over the iterable, calculating the sum of the inverse of the values of X from the list provided.

### _Mathematical Calculation_

The len in-built function gives how many values of X are present in the list before being added to the sum of the inverse of the values of x.

The try and except statement is used to handle "zero division error" here in the calculation of the harmonic mean.
